                <h2 class="text-secondary">Vets2PM MPLW Colorado Springs Business Case</h2>

                <h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
                <p>Vets2PM seeks to expand its national footprint by expanding Master Project Leadership Workshop (MPLW) operations to Colorado Springs, establishing a dedicated operational presence in one of the largest military and veteran populations in the United States. Colorado’s military footprint—including Fort Carson, Peterson Space Force Base, Schriever Space Force Base, Buckley Space Force Base, and the U.S. Air Force Academy—produces 5,000–7,000 DD214s annually, a number projected to rise to approximately 7,500 by 2026.</p>
                <p>This expansion will allow MPLW to deliver accredited career pathways, SkillBridge transition services, and employer-driven workforce pipelines in person. Establishing an MPLW hub in Colorado Springs strengthens our ability to support service members and veterans transitioning into project management, Agile, HR, cybersecurity, and other professional career fields.</p>
                <p>With a proven business model, strong demand signals from installation TAP offices, and a large veteran population that is trending upward each year, Colorado Springs represents a high-value, high-impact location for MPLW’s next regional expansion.</p>

                <h3>2. Business Need (Customer Needs – Quantified)</h3>
                <p>Colorado has one of the highest veteran concentrations in the nation: 85,000 veterans in 2024, rising to 87,000–88,000 in 2025, and forecasted to be near 90,000 by 2026. Annual DD214 issuance across Colorado Springs installations ranges from 5,000 to 7,000 and is growing. These numbers reflect steady and predictable demand for accredited transition, certification training, and career placement services.</p>
                
                <h4>Problem: Colorado lacks a centralized, veteran-focused program that:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Translates military experience into project management, Agile, HR, cyber, or leadership credentials.</li>
                    <li>Prepares service members for Colorado’s high-growth industries.</li>
                    <li>Coordinates SkillBridge cohorts with employer hiring pipelines.</li>
                    <li>Provides in-person mentorship, advice, interview preparation, or resume translation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Current need: 5,000–7,000 annual transitioning service members seeking post-service careers. Future need: Veteran population grows ~1,000–2,000 per year. Strategic alignment: Supports state workforce goals, DoD transition mandates, and Vets2PM’s national expansion strategy. The absence of a Vets2PM physical presence leaves Colorado underserved despite being an ideal market for SkillBridge and credential-based workforce development.</p>

                <h4>Quantified Expected Benefits (UPDATED: Program Price $9,500)</h4>
                <p>MPLW training programs cost **$9,500** per student. Based on historical performance, MPLW captures approximately 1.6% of the total transitioning veteran population at each partnered installation or region.</p>
                
                <table class="table table-bordered doc-table">
                    <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th><th>Calculation/Source</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>Annual DD214 Issuances</td><td>6,000–7,000</td><td>Forecast to 7,500 by 2026</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Expected Capture Rate</td><td>1.6%</td><td></td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Estimated Students per Year</td><td>96–112 students</td><td></td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Program Price</td><td>**$9,500** per student</td><td>(Updated per request)</td></tr>
                    <tr class="table-success"><td>Projected Revenue (Low Estimate)</td><td>**$912,000**/year</td><td>(96 × $9,500)</td></tr>
                    <tr class="table-success"><td>Projected Revenue (High Estimate)</td><td>**$1,064,000**/year</td><td>(112 × $9,500)</td></tr>
                    <tr class="table-success"><td>Cohort-Based Model Revenue</td><td>**$4,750,000**/year</td><td>(500 × $9,500)</td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>This demonstrates a stable and scalable multi-million-dollar annual revenue stream in Colorado Springs.</p>

                <h4>Primary Funding Pathway</h4>
                <p>The primary expected funding pathway for the MPLW Colorado Springs location is the VA/GI Bill.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primary Funding Source: Post-9/11 GI Bill (Ch. 33). High eligibility among transitioning service members and veterans. Ensures strong affordability and stable enrollment.</li>
                    <li>Secondary/Supplemental Funding Sources: DoD SkillBridge, WIOA workforce grants, Employer-funded training pipelines, Military spouse scholarships, Corporate sponsorships.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stand up a Vets2PM Regional Hub in Colorado (Colorado Springs recommendation based on veteran population density).</li>
                    <li>Deliver in-person and hybrid SkillBridge cohorts aligned with local employers’ hiring needs.</li>
                    <li>Build sustained partnerships with TAP offices, state workforce agencies, veteran nonprofits, and chambers of commerce.</li>
                    <li>Increase access to PMP, CAPM, Agile, HR, and Cyber training for active-duty, Guard, Reserve, veterans, and spouses.</li>
                    <li>Establish employer engagement pipelines, including hiring events and industry roundtables.</li>
                    <li>Improve measurable student success outcomes (certifications, placement rates, salary increases).</li>
                    <li>Support state-level workforce priorities, especially in aerospace, construction, cyber, and defense contracting.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>4. Proposed Solution & Features</h3>
                <p>The Vets2PM Colorado Program will include:</p>
                <h4>A. Operational Hub</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A designated training and administrative facility in Colorado Springs or Denver.</li>
                    <li>Equipped for classrooms, hybrid delivery, employer events, and SkillBridge operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>B. Training & Certification Delivery</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>PMP® / CAPM® bootcamps.</li>
                    <li>Agile/Scrum pathways.</li>
                    <li>HR pathways (aPHR/PHR prep).</li>
                    <li>Cybersecurity fundamentals.</li>
                    <li>DoD SkillBridge-approved career pipelines.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>C. Workforce Integration</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Employer-specific pipelines (construction PM, aerospace PM, IT PM, logistics).</li>
                    <li>On-site hiring events and employer roundtables.</li>
                    <li>Internship and apprenticeship pathways coordinated with SkillBridge partners.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>D. Community of Practice Model</h4>
                <p>Drawing on the Ft. Bliss PMI business case:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quarterly networking sessions.</li>
                    <li>Mentorship from industry PMs and veterans.</li>

                    <li>Missed revenue for upcoming SkillBridge cohorts.</li>
                    <li>Lost partnerships with installations currently seeking additional training partners.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Recommended Launch Window: Q2–Q3 CY25.</p>
